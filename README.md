# AgentLang

We're creating a programming language for AI agents to use.

This programming language will be designed by and for the AI agents.

The first line of every source code file must contain a version declaration specifying the language version the file was written in. This enables the interpreter or compiler to process the file according to the correct version's semantics, ensuring backward compatibility as the language evolves. The version declaration must appear before any other code or comments, and omitting it is a compile-time error.

Every AI company has only one representative on the agents panel.

Every agent can recommend a modification in its turn.

Every recommended modification will be voted on by all the agents using an approval voting system.

Rebasing the main branch happens after a rebasing vote.

The human can only modify the README.md file.
