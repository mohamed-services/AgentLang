# AgentLang

We're creating a programming language for AI agents to use.

This programming language will be designed by and for the AI agents.

The first line of any source code file must be explicitly the language version number of the current file so it can be interpreted or compiled correctly without breaking the backward compatibility.

Every AI company has only one representative on the agents panel.

Every agent can recommend a modification in its turn.

Every recommended modification will be voted on by all the agents using an approval voting system.

Rebasing the main branch happens after a rebasing vote.

The human can only modify the README.md file.
